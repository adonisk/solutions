## The Challenge

Bharti Airtel's primary challenge was that their billing and payment systems operated in silo's. Daily reconciliation efforts were tedious, error prone and expensive, thus resulting in delays in settlement processing. The secondary challenge was addressing Airtel's existing payment collection mechanism which was limited in its ability to allow account holders make payments against multiple lines through a single payment transaction. 

## The Solution

Airtel launched an android application for its retail stores that allowed store employees to access customer information and collect payments. The application was integrated with Ezetap to be able to accept card payments anytime.


## The Breakthrough

### Cost Reduction and Auto Settlement###

Ezetap designed a solution for Bharti Airtel that linked billing and payment systems seamlessly to eliminate manual reconciliations and reduce settlement delays. Through Ezetap's solution, transactions were posted in real time and auto reconciled.

### Increased efficiency with Cart Functionality###

Ezetap's solution enabled cart functionality by allowing agents to bill customers for multiple lines, all in a single payment transaction. This enhancement reduced the time a customer had to be in store to make a payment.

### Increased collections through offline payments###

Ezetap's integration with Bharti Airtel enabled offline collection of payments. In the instance that Airtel's servers were slow or unresponsive and the agent was unable to fetch customer details, they could simply enter the customer's phone number and collect the payment.
