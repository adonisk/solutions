## The Challenge

ACT Broadband's primary challenge was that their sales and collections agents often faced network issues in certain areas of the city on sales and collection runs. It was therefore, critical, for ACT broadband to have a local offline sales and collections list and a local offline payment collection mechanism.

## The Solution

Ezetap designed a single Mobile Point of Sale application with the ability to collect card payments for ACT sales and collections executives, wherein, upon login, the agent could download their sales or collections list to an offline store on their mobile device (list could only be accessed through the Ezetap application) as well as collect offline payments that would auto sync to the ACT server when the agent was online.

## The Breakthrough

### Increased efficiency via offline collections and payments ###

By integrating with Ezetap, ACT Broadband agents were able to download their daily collections list every morning to an offline store and collect payments from customers without worrying about network issues. The result of this was more payment collections on a daily basis

### Improved documentation and tracking of customer interaction ###

Ezetap's customized application enabled sales and collections agents document customer interaction in a digital manner that could easily be recorded in backend systems. If the agent was in an area with poor connectivity, they could still process a payment through a digital receipt without fetching customer details. If the customer was not available, the agent could record an uncollected payment.

### Increased Customer Satisfaction ###

The ability for an agent to collect a card payment at the customer's doorstep was convenient and time saving since customers otherwise had to go to a store and make a payment to avoid service interruption.

### Enhanced Reporting Capabilities ###

By providing additional customization through the mobile application, ACT Broadband was able to enhance its reporting capabilities significantly. The customization enabled reporting against successful payments, offline payments and  uncollected payments on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.
