## The Challenge

ACT Broadband's primary challenge was that their sales and collections agents often faced network issues in certain areas of the city on sales and collection runs. It was therefore, critical, for ACT broadband to have a local offline sales and collections list and a local offline payment collection mechanism.

## The Solution

Ezetap designed a single Mobile Point of Sale application with the ability to collect card payments for ACT sales and collections executives for broadband and cable services, wherein, upon login, based on the agent's profile they could download their broadband sales or broadband and cable collections list to an offline store on their mobile device (the lists could only be accessed through the Ezetap application). Upon receiving their daily list, the agent could collect payments through several methods depending on whether they were in an area with strong or weak network reception.

## The Breakthrough

### Increased efficiency via offline collections and payments ###

By integrating with Ezetap, ACT Broadband agents were able to download their daily collections list every morning to a local data store and collect payments from customers without worrying about network issues. If the agent was "online", they could enter customer account number or CAF No. and fetch customer details from the offline store. If the agent was "offline", they could enter the relevant customer details and still collect a payment which would be posted online once the agent had network connectivity. The integration with Ezetap enabled an seamless offline to online payment sync

### Improved Payment Collection Experience ###

Ezetap's solution opened a new payment avenue for ACT Boadband's customers. By enabling card payments, collection runs were completed on time and agents could focus their attention on upselling features. 

### Increased Customer Satisfaction ###

Ezetap's card payment capability provided customer's with a more convenient option of paying their bills. Customer's who previously risked service interruption if they did not have cash on hand, could make payments using a card and receive digital receipts and invoices in real time. 

### Enhanced Reporting Capabilities ###

Ezetap enabled additional customization on the Mobile Application for ACT Broadband including separate login credentials for collections and sales agents, Digital Receipts (for offline transactions) and Service Level Complaints (when customers were unavailable). ACT Broadband executives could track status of online and offline payments successful payments, failed payments and uncollected payments on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. These additional insights significantly improved ACT Broadband's operational efficiency.
