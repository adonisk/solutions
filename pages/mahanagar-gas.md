## The Challenge
MGL primarily equips a collection agent with a Tablet Application that reads the consumer Gas Consumption, translates the readings into an invoice for the transaction amount. The agent also carries a portable printer to generate the Bill and the Receipt Payment.This setup perfectly works fine and people are happy to pay when the payments are below Rs. 500 but the when the payments go beyond Rs. 500 people's willingness to pay by Card increases. The challenge the collections agents often faced was lack of enough funds with the customer to pay for the Gas consumption, once the meter reading was translated into an invoice. Collection agents often had to visit the same customer multiple times to complete the payment transaction.

## The Solution

MGL approached Ezetap to integrate their card payment solution to MGL's tablet billing application to enable card payment as an additional payment instrument when the collection agents visited customers. Ezetap's solution provided the capability of processing card transactions and recording cash and cheque transactions, which were posted to the Ezetap and client servers upon payment completion.
