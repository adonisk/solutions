The basic MPOS has the functionality to populate generic fields (Amount, Reference number etc.), collect a payment and send a digital receipt. Ezetap will send an apk file to the client to download the basic POS. Clients who have implemented the basic MPOS are **Retail stores and Kirana stores.**

### Ezetap SDK (Software Development Kit)
Ezetap exposes client side SDK to enable businesses integrate the Ezetap payment flow into their existing mobile, tablet or desktop applications via a standard SDK integration. Ezetap's SDK consists of a Basic POS and payment integration solution. Clients can either use the Basic MPOS and SDK or just the SDK, depending on whether they have an in house payment collection application.Ezetap offers SDK integration on Android (Hybrid JS and Native Android) and Windows platforms. The Ezetap SDK's can be downloaded [here](http://docs.ezetap.com). Clients who have implemented the SDK are **Amazon, Myntra, BAGIC, Airtel, Urban Ladder, Pepperfry etc**. 


# Additional Features

### Merchant Portal

### Notification API
Ezetap exposes a notifications API as a callback feature for a client to receive notification of payment transactions (success or failure). The primary benefit of this service is auto-reconciliation of daily transactions between client server and Ezetap server.
